# Computer Vision Projects Repository

Welcome to the Computer Vision Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects that I have developed. Each project focuses on different aspects of computer vision and provides implementation examples, datasets, and instructions on how to use them.

## Projects

### 1. Face and emotion recognition model

- Description: By building robust models using TensorFlow and utilizing the Cascade
Classifier from OpenCV, we achieved accurate identification of individuals and their
facial expressions .
- Technologies:  Python, TensorFlow.
- Examples: The end of the note book shows a clear exemple.
- References: We utilized the FER2013 dataset as the foundation for training and evaluating our facial recognition and expression analysis model..

### 2. CNN for Digit Recognizer (MNIST, Tensorflow)

- Description:A writen-Digit recognizer by a CNN using Tensorflow library .
- Technologies: Python, CNN, TensorFlow.
- References: We have used the MNIST dataset.
